In summary of the implemented features. First we changed the models and associations of the first assigment, because
we had many problems with it. After that we created the API controller, with all roots and another many thing, with the API 
controller we can created the Postman methods (get, create, update, delete). The link of Postman is below. 
Then we created the others controllers and edit the HTML view of them, different types of methods had to be implemented.
With Bootstrap an another two CSS files, we can make a greate view of the web application. (we created a Home controller instead the Page controller).

We could not make de validations of HTML and CSS. We do not know how make the validations, we try many differents ways, but was impossible,
we suppouse the HTML and CSS are fine, because they work well. We did not show the comments replies and the messages, because this
was not especificated in this assignament and we do not know if this is necessary for this assignament.(we supposed the objective of this assignament were 
the events, comments, profiles, organizaions, home page, Postman)
